### Background
Sprocket Central Pty Ltd is a medium-sized company specializing in high-quality bicycles and accessories. They requested that we analyze their customer data with a goal of optimizing the company's marketing strategy.

My tasks are to assess the data quality, target high-value customers and develop a data-driven marketing plan. By leveraging customer data, we aim to provide valuable insights and recommendations to drive business growth.

During this project, the following tasks were performed:

1. Performed EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) and wrote an email to Sprocket concerning the quality of the dataset.

2. Performed data cleaning and built a model using RFM analysis which was used to segment customers to know those among the new 1000 customers Sprocket should target during advertisements and this was displayed on the powerpoint slides.

3. Built a dashboard using powerBi to visualize the result of the analysis performed.

### Datasets and Tools

The tools used; Microsoft Excel and Power BI.
